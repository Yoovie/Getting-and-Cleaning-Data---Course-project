1. Loads Testing and Training files
2. Loads Features and Activities
3. Renames the columns
4. Merge Testing and Training data sets into one
5. Create a subset by excluding measurements not related to mean and st.dev
6. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable
7. Write this new set into TidySet.txt
